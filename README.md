# extra details i didn't mention (things I learned, difficulties, what I enjoyed)
This semester was really mentally difficult for me, so I used this project more as a learning experience rather than creating something really impressive. This is my first time using an object-oriented programming language, so I wanted to learn how to initialize objects and how effectively use them to put together a game with resources other than lecture. I know my project may not be as "good" as other students, but I'm okay with that considering how much I learned from this assignment. The assignment helped me learn that things in CS aren't always easy, and I may have to restart a few times, and I may have to lower my expectations-- and that's okay! I'm proud of myself for pushing through and continuing with Lua/LOVE2D rather than giving up and using to something I'm more comfortable with (ex. Python, R).
